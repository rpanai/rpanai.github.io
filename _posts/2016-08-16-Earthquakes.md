title: Earthquakes Data Analisys 
---

After the last earthquake in [Italy](http://www.usgs.gov/news/magnitude-62-earthquake-central-italy) I was surprised by this [statement](http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2016/08/24/mario-tozzi_n_11672740.html) "Italy is like Middle East. An earthquake of magnitude 6 should not generate such a disaster". There are several things I don't like about that statement, furthermore I moved to New Zealand few months after the [2011 Christchurch earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Christchurch_earthquake) and that was another magnitudo 6 earthquake.
